# Neon Thicc
This is a branch of the Neon Knights Blue theme for XFCE4 by Jorge Domingo Cabrera Vel√°zquez.
It's essentially the same, but it uses 4 px wide borders, rather than 1 px.
This makes it much easier to grab the window borders for resizing with a mouse.

## Installation
Put the `Neon_Thicc` directory in `$HOME/.themes/`

## Changing the Color
Use the `modulate.sh` script to create a new theme with different coloration.
See the comments of `modulate.sh` for usage.
This requires ImageMagick and Bash (though many other shells would probably work).
